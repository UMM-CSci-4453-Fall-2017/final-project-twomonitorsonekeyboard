# Oracle DB Installation (Windows)
**This is a reference guide to installing as well as how we installed OracleDB on both a linux and Windows Environment. This document explores the Windows Environment**

### Prequisites:
* We needed root permission to lab computers when installing because of some files that need to be modified are in the _/etc/_ folder.
* We were granted sudo permission to modify these files
* Additonally the lab computers run Fedora 25
